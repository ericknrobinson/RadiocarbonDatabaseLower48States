4. Taxa - additional information (e.g., species) about the material submitted for dating.
5. Type - context of radiocarbon date; options are: "ARCHAEOLOGICAL" "PALEONTOLOGICAL" or "GEOLOGICAL"
6. County - county where radiocarbon dated material came from
7. Measured - measured radiocarbon years before present (fractionation not accounted for)
8. Mea_SE - standard error for measured radiocarbon age
9. Norm - normalized radiocarbon years before present (corrected for fractionation)
10. Norm_SE - standard error for normalized radiocarbon age
11. 13C - Î´13C value for radiocarbon sample
12. SiteID - archaeological site number for origin of dated material (normally Smithsonian numbers)

16. Strat - any notes on the stratigraphic context of the radiocarbon dated material
17. Context - any contextual notes for the origin of the radiocarbon dated material
18. AMS_Radio - indicates the method used to run the radiocarbon date; options are: "AMS" "RADIOMETRIC" "RADIOMETRICPLUS"
19. Comments - any additional comments about radiocarbon date
20. Reference - reference information for where the date information was found; often abbreviated to author last name, year, and first few words of the title
